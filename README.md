Utilizing multiple Python libraries was part of the process, although the execution itself was manual rather than relying on library functions like OpenCV.

The approach taken for implementation was guided by the content of the original research paper, alongside another paper detailing the application of the GrabCut algorithm.

Incorporated within the project are datasets intended for testing purposes, along with reference data that serves as the ground truth for evaluating the performance of GrabCut. Additionally, an implementation for assessing accuracy and Jaccard index in relation to the ground truth is included.
