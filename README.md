# Grabcut-and-Possion-Blending-in-Python
The implementation was based on both the original research paper and the implementation paper of the GrabCut algorithm. The algorithm was manually implemented, without resorting to extended libraries like OpenCV. The only Python libraries employed were those aimed at optimizing computational efficiency, such as Numpy.
